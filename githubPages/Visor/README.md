### Visor:

#### Url: 

[https://trianguloy.github.io/githubPages/Visor/visor.html](https://trianguloy.github.io/githubPages/Visor/visor.html)

#### Description:

Displays a video from a url directly on the browser (without downloading). It uses the video player of the browser, so unfortunately it only appears to work with some files and some browsers. [It seems to work with most .mp4 files on firefox and chrome, also with some .mkv on chrome, some audios too, ...].

You can append the url of the video after a "?" to autoload a predefined url (will be also autoplayed if the browser allows it, otherwise you need to press play). For example: [https://trianguloy.github.io/githubPages/Visor/visor.html?https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/240/big_buck_bunny_240p_30mb.mp4](https://trianguloy.github.io/githubPages/Visor/visor.html?https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/240/big_buck_bunny_240p_30mb.mp4)
