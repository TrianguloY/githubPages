#### Description:

This page allows you to search any query from [derpibooru](https://derpibooru.org/) and display the results in an endless scrollable view.

The page was developed mainly from a mobile device using a text editor, so I apologize for the unconventional programming (latter was prettified using a computer). In any case I think it is pretty good and the reason why raw html is so powerful and easy to use. No frameworks, no libraries, nothing. All in a single file, and it works fine!

Contains some configuration to suit each need. This was made for personal use from a mobile device and may or may not update it, depending on how much I use it, but if you find it useful any discussion/request is welcomed.
