#### Description:

This is a custom implementation of the [Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Neumann_theorem).

This was made as a response to the [Petr’s miracle: Why was it lost for 100 years? (Mathologer Masterclass)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLAW5yz5O3E) video by Mathologer.
